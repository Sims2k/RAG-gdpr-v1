The right to the prote ction of personal \ndata is not an absolute right ; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against \nother fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of propor tionality . This Regulation respects all \nfundamental rights and obser ves the freedoms and principles recognised in the Char ter as enshr ined in the \nTreaties, in particular the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of \npersonal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to \nconduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic \ndiversity . \n(5)  The economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the intern al mark et has led to a substantial \nincrease in cross-border flows of personal data. The exchange of personal data between public and private actor s, \nincluding natural persons, associations and under takings across the Union has increased. National author ities in \nthe Member State s are being called upon by Union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able \nto perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an author ity in another Member State . \n(6)  Rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal \ndata. The scale of the collection and shar ing of personal data has increased signif icantly . Techn ology allows both \nprivate companies and public author ities to mak e use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to \npursue their activities. Natural persons increasing ly mak e personal information available publicly and globally . \nTechnology has transf ormed both the econom y and social life, and should further facilitat e the free flow of \npersonal data within the Union and the transfer to third countr ies and international orga nisations, while ensur ing \na high level of the protection of personal data. \n(7)  Those developments require a strong and more coherent data prot ection framew ork in the Union, back ed by \nstrong enforcement, given the impor tance of creating the trust that will allow the digital econom y to develop \nacross the internal mark et. Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical \ncertainty for natural persons, economic operat ors and public author ities should be enhanced. \n(8)  Where this Regulation provides for specific ations or restr ictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States \nmay, as far as necessar y for coherence and for making the national provisions compreh ensible to the persons to \nwhom they apply , incor porate elements of this Regulation into their national law. \n(9)  The objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevente d fragmentation in the \nimplementation of data protection across the Union, legal uncer tainty or a widespread public percep tion that \nthere are signif icant risks to the protection of natural persons, in particular with regar d to online activity . \nDifferences in the level of prote ction of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the \nprot ection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the \nfree flow of personal data throughout the Union. Those diffe rences may theref ore constitute an obstacle to the \npursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distor t competition and impede author ities in the \ndisc harge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such a differ ence in levels of protection is due to the \nexisten ce of differ ences in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC. \n(10)  In order to ensure a consistent and high level of prot ection of natural persons and to remo ve the obstacles to \nflows of personal data within the Union, the level of prot ection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons \nwith regar d to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consisten t and \nhomog enous application of the rules for the prote ction of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural \npersons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the \nprocessing of personal data for compl iance with a legal oblig ation, for the performa nce of a task carried out in \nthe public interest or in the exer cise of offici al author ity vested in the controller , Member States should be \nallowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this \nRegulation.

This Regulation should not, theref ore, apply \nto processing activities for those purposes. However , personal data processed by public author ities under this \nRegulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more specific Union legal act, namely \nDirective (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). Member States may entr ust \ncompet ent author ities within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessar ily \ncarried out for the purposes of the prevention, inve stigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the \nexecuti on of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public secur ity, so \nthat the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is within the scope of Union law, \nfalls within the scope of this Regulation. \nWith regard to the processing of personal data by those compet ent author ities for purposes falling within scope \nof this Regulation, Member States should be able to maintain or introduce more specifi c provisions to adapt the \napplication of the rules of this Regulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements \nfor the processing of personal data by those compet ent author ities for those other purposes, taking into account \nthe constitutional, organisational and administrative structure of the respective Member State . When the \nprocessing of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation, this Regulation should \nprovide for the possibility for Member States under specifi c conditions to restr ict by law certain oblig ations and \nrights when such a restr iction constitute s a necessar y and propor tionat e measure in a democratic society to \nsafeg uard specific important interests including public secur ity and the prevention, investigation, detection or \nprosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the \nprevention of threats to public secur ity. This is relevant for instance in the framework of anti-money launder ing \nor the activities of forensic laboratori es. \n(20)  While this Regulation applies, inter alia, to the activities of cour ts and other judicial author ities, Union or \nMember State law could specify the processing operations and processing procedures in relation to the \nprocessing of personal data by cour ts and other judicial author ities. The compe tence of the super visor y \nauthor ities should not cover the processing of personal data when cour ts are acting in their judicial capacity , in \norder to safeg uard the independence of the judiciar y in the performa nce of its judicial tasks, including decision- \nmaking. It should be possible to entr ust super vision of such data processing operations to specific bodies within \nthe judicial system of the Member State , which should, in particular ensure compl iance with the rules of this \nRegulation, enhance awar eness among members of the judiciar y of their oblig ations under this Regulation and \nhandle compl aints in relation to such data processing operations. \n(21)  This Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and \nof the Council (2), in particular of the liability rules of interm ediar y service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that \nDirective.

In order to \ndetermine whether such a controller or processor is offer ing goods or services to data subjects who are in the \nUnion, it should be ascer tained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offer ing services \nto data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, \nprocessor's or an interm ediar y's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use \nof a language generally used in the third countr y where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascer tain \nsuch intenti on, factors such as the use of a language or a currency general ly used in one or more Member States \nwith the possibility of order ing goods and services in that other languag e, or the mentioning of custome rs or \nusers who are in the Union, may make it apparent that the controller envisages offer ing goods or services to data \nsubjects in the Union. \n(24)  The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not \nestablished in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitori ng of the \nbeha viour of such data subjects in so far as their behavi our takes place within the Union. In order to determine \nwhether a processing activity can be considered to monit or the beha viour of data subjects, it should be \nascer tained whether natural persons are tracked on the intern et including potential subsequent use of personal \ndata processing techniques which consist of prof iling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions \nconcer ning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, beha viours and attitudes. \n(25)  Where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation should also apply to a \ncontroller not established in the Union, such as in a Member State 's diplomatic mission or consular post. \n(26)  The principles of data prote ction should apply to any information concer ning an identif ied or identifiable natural \nperson. Personal data which have undergone pseudon ymisation, whic h could be attributed to a natural person by \nthe use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identif iable natural person. To \ndetermine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to \nbe used, such as sing ling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly \nor indirectly . To ascer tain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account \nshould be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identif ication, \ntaking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. \nThe principles of data protection should theref ore not apply to anonymous information, namely information \nwhic h does not relate to an identified or identif iable natural person or to personal data rendered anonym ous in \nsuch a manner that the data subject is not or no long er identifiable. This Regulation does not theref ore concer n \nthe processing of such anony mous information, including for statistical or research purposes. \n(27)  This Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons.

That criterion should not \ndepend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of \ntechnical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not, in themselves, \nconstitut e a main establishment and are theref ore not determining criteria for a main establishment. The main \nestablishment of the processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or, if it has no \ncentral administration in the Union, the place where the main processing activities take place in the Union.

The consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be \nnecessar y in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child. \n(39)  Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons that \npersonal data concer ning them are collect ed, used, consulte d or other wise processed and to what extent the \npersonal data are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any information and communi \u00ad\ncation relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear \nand plain language be used. That principle concer ns, in particular , information to the data subjects on the \nidentity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and \ntransparent processing in respect of the natural persons concer ned and their right to obtain conf irmation and \ncommunication of personal data concer ning them whic h are being processed. Natural persons should be made \nawar e of risks, rules, safeg uards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exer cise their \nrights in relation to such processing. In particular , the specific purposes for which personal data are processed \nshould be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data. The personal \ndata should be adequate, relevant and limite d to what is necessar y for the purposes for whic h they are processed. \nThis requires, in particular , ensur ing that the period for whic h the personal data are stored is limited to a strict \nminimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be \nfulfilled by other means.

Some types of processing may serve both impor tant grounds \nof public interest and the vital inter ests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessar y for \nhumanitar ian purposes, including for monitori ng epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitar ian \nemerg encies, in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters. \n(47)  The legitimate inter ests of a controller , including those of a controller to which the personal data may be \ndisclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the \nfundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable \nexpectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller . Such legitimate interest could exist \nfor example where there is a relevant and appropr iate relationship between the data subject and the controller in \nsituations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller . At any rate the existen ce of \na legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the \ntime and in the cont ext of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. \nThe inter ests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the inter est of the data \ncontroller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect \nfurther processing. Given that it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public author ities to \nprocess personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing by public author ities in the \nperforma nce of their tasks. The processing of personal data strictly necessar y for the purposes of preventing \nfraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concer ned. The processing of personal data for \ndirect mark eting purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate inter est. \n(48)  Controllers that are part of a group of under takings or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a \nlegitimate inter est in transmitting personal data within the group of under takings for internal administrative \npurposes, including the processing of clients' or employees' personal data. The general principles for the transfe r \nof personal data, within a group of under takings, to an under taking locat ed in a third countr y remain unaffect ed. \n(49)  The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessar y and propor tionate for the purposes of ensur ing \nnetw ork and information secur ity, i.e. the ability of a network or an information syste m to resist, at a given level \nof conf idence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availabi lity, authenticity , \nintegrity and confidentiality of store d or transmitte d personal data, and the secur ity of the related services offered \nby, or accessible via, those netw orks and systems, by public author ities, by comput er emerge ncy response teams \n(CERT s), comput er secur ity incident response teams (CSIRT s), by providers of electronic communications \nnetw orks and services and by providers of secur ity technologies and services, constitutes a legitimat e interest of \nthe data controller concer ned. This could, for exam ple, include preventing unauthor ised access to electronic \ncommunications netw orks and malicious code distr ibution and stoppi ng \u2018denial of service \u2019 attacks and damage to \ncomput er and electronic communication systems. \n(50)  The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collect ed \nshould be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were \ninitially collect ed. In such a case, no lega l basis separate from that whic h allowed the collection of the personal \ndata is required.

Further more, the data subject should be informed of the \nexisten ce of profiling and the consequences of such prof iling. Where the personal data are collect ed from the \ndata subject, the data subject should also be informed whether he or she is oblig ed to provide the personal data \nand of the consequences, where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided in \ncombination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner , a \nmeaningful overview of the intende d processing. Where the icons are presented electronically , they should be \nmachi ne-readable. \n(61)  The information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be given to him \nor her at the time of collection from the data subject, or, where the personal data are obtained from another \nsource, within a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal data can be \nlegitimate ly disclosed to another recipient, the data subject should be informed when the personal data are first \ndisclosed to the recipient.

Where the origin of the personal data \ncannot be provided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general information should be \nprovided. \n(62)  However , it is not necessar y to imp ose the oblig ation to provide information where the data subject already \npossesses the information, where the recording or disclosure of the personal data is expressly laid down by law \nor where the provision of information to the data subject proves to be imp ossible or would involve a dispropor \u00ad\ntionate effort. The latter could in particular be the case where processing is carried out for archiving purposes in \nthe public interest, scientific or histo rical research purposes or statistical purposes. In that regard, the number of \ndata subjects, the age of the data and any appropr iate safeg uards adopt ed should be take n into consideration. \n(63)  A data subject should have the right of access to personal data whic h have been collect ed concer ning him or her, \nand to exercise that right easily and at reasonable inter vals, in order to be awar e of, and verify, the lawfulness of \nthe processing.

Where possible, the controller should be able to provide \nremot e access to a secure system which would provide the data subject with direct access to his or her personal \ndata. That right should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade secrets or intellectual \nproper ty and in particular the copyright protecting the software. However , the result of those considerations \nshould not be a refusal to provide all information to the data subject.

Where such \nnotification cannot be achi eved within 72 hours, the reasons for the dela y should accompan y the notification \nand information may be provided in phases without undue further dela y. \n(86)  The controller should communicate to the data subject a personal data breac h, without undue dela y, where that \npersonal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the natural person in order to \nallow him or her to take the necessar y precautions. The communication should descr ibe the nature of the \npersonal data breach as well as recommendations for the natural person concer ned to mitig ate potential adverse \neffects. Such communications to data subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close \ncooperation with the super visor y author ity, respecting guidance provided by it or by other relevant author ities \nsuch as law-enf orcement author ities. For example, the need to mitigat e an immediat e risk of damage would call \nfor promp t communication with data subjects whereas the need to implement appropr iate measures against \ncontinuing or similar personal data breac hes may justify more time for communication. \n(87)  It should be ascer tained whether all appropr iate technological protect ion and organisational measures have been \nimplemented to establish immediately whether a personal data breach has take n place and to inform prom ptly \nthe super visor y author ity and the data subject. The fact that the notifi cation was made without undue dela y \nshould be established taking into account in particular the nature and gravity of the personal data breac h and its \nconsequences and adverse effects for the data subject. Such notifi cation may result in an inter vention of the \nsuper visor y author ity in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation. \n(88)  In setting detailed rules concer ning the format and procedures applicable to the notificati on of personal data \nbreac hes, due consideration should be given to the circumstances of that breac h, including whether or not \npersonal data had been prot ected by appropr iate technical protection measures, effectively limiting the likelihood \nof identity fraud or other forms of misuse. Moreo ver, such rules and procedures should take into account the \nlegitimate interests of law-enf orcement author ities where early disclosure could unnecessar ily ham per the investi \u00ad\ngation of the circumstances of a personal data breac h. \n(89)  Directive 95/46/EC provided for a general oblig ation to notify the processing of personal data to the super visor y \nauthor ities. While that oblig ation produces administrative and financial burdens, it did not in all cases contr ibut e \nto improving the prot ection of personal data. Such indiscr iminate general notificati on oblig ations should \ntheref ore be abolished, and replaced by effective procedures and mecha nisms whic h focus instead on those types \nof processing operations whic h are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons by \nvirtue of their nature, scope, context and purposes.

The extrat erritorial application of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in \nbreac h of internatio nal law and may impede the attainment of the protect ion of natural persons ensured in the \nUnion by this Regulation.
